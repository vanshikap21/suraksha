# 🤖 Suraksha-AI: Guarding Motherhood with Intelligence

## 🌟 Overview

**Suraksha-AI** is a machine learning-powered health monitoring system designed to reduce maternal mortality by detecting **hypertensive disorders** and **anemia** using non-invasive methods in low-resource settings. Our mission is to ensure **safe pregnancies** through early and intelligent health monitoring, especially in rural or underserved areas.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

India loses approximately **30,000 mothers every year** due to preventable conditions like:

- **Hypertensive disorders** (preeclampsia/eclampsia)
- **Anemia**, often undetected between antenatal visits

These complications go unnoticed because of:
- Limited healthcare access in rural areas
- Infrequent ANC visits
- Lack of immediate diagnostic tools

---

## 💡 Our 2-in-1 Solution: Suraksha-AI

### 🤖 1. AI-Based Anemia Detector

> A non-invasive, low-cost tool to detect anemia using just a smartphone camera.

- 📷 Uses image of **lower eyelid** or **nail bed**
- 🧠 Applies **deep learning and image processing** to analyze color/brightness
- 📊 Classifies anemia into **Low / Medium / High Risk**
- 🌐 Works offline, ideal for **rural or resource-poor settings**

### 🩺 2. mPatch: Wearable Vital Sign Monitor

> A smart, flexible patch that monitors essential vitals for pregnant women.

- ❤️ Tracks **Blood Pressure, Temperature, SpO₂, and Heart Rate**
- 📡 Sends real-time **danger alerts** via **mock LoRa / SMS**
- 📲 **Health Dashboard** displays alerts to caregivers and family
- 🔋 Designed to be **low-power and low-cost**, ideal for long-term use
